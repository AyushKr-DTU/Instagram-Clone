        In the eyes of millions of his fellow Indians,
        Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”). The unthinking
        adoration of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all
        along the route of his tours made them a severe ordeal;
        could hardly work during the day or rest at night. “The woes
        of the Mahatmas,” he wrote, “are known only to the Mahatmas.”

        after his death. The name Mahatma Gandhi is now one of the most
        universally recognized on earth.
